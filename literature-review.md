Image registration is the alignment of images across a given domain, as even samples of the same object will be subject to misalignment due to outside factors. This problem is solved by applying a transform function to the coordinates of a floating image (the image being changed) to align to a static reference image. To arrive at the solution, the correct translation, rotation, scaling, and distortion functions must be applied to match the coordinate systems of the floating image and reference image (Brown 1992). Registration techniques can be used for single patient data, or between multiple patients, for comparative analysis. For example, each time a patient gets an MRI scan, their body may be positioned slightly differently each time, making it difficult to compare and quantify changes in the images across multiple visits. Some problems associated with registration are the presence of noise, and dealing with cross-modal registration. Quantitatively, registration can be intensity-based (comparing raw intensity values per pixel) or feature-based (comparing patterns, contours, etc. found in swaths of neighboring pixels), and can also be analyzed from a spatial or frequency domain (applying a Fourier transform) (Brown 1992). Noise can be overcome using methods that aren’t affected heavily by noise, such as most forms of feature detection (as the noise is less significant over a larger area), or frequency domain analysis as noise is removed when the image is decomposed (Brown 1992). As an output intensity from one modality is not one-to-one with an intensity in another, For example, a black pixel in MR imaging could be bone or air, while in X-ray a bone will show up as a lightly-colored pixel. 

Current techniques to solve the for the transformation while mitigating these problems are varied. Most co-registration methods utilize four overarching steps (Zitova 2003). First, they find a set of notable features such as corners, or bounded areas, which varies from algorithm to algorithm (Zitova 2003). Second, reducing features to their singular key points, the characteristics of the source and reference images are compared (Zitova 2003). Third, the transform functions necessary to best match the features of the two images is computed, and fourth it is applied to the image and smoothed (Zitova 2003). One method of checking whether the features are matched well is measurement of the amount of information contained in an intensity, like Shannon entropy (Pluim 2003). Shannon entropy is an outgrowth of Hartley entropy, which considers the information provided as the logarithm of the number of possible combinations (Pluim 2003). Shannon entropy also incorporates the probability of each choice, with a more probable choice providing less information (Pluim 2003). Mutual information, then, can be taken as the change in Shannon entropy (information in the intensity of the pixel in one image) when the intensity in the other image is known. (Pluim 2003). In other words, clusters of intensities (tissue regions) should vary in intensity in a related way, which would lead to more information about the pixel in the other image and therefore lower the entropy. (Pluim 2003). Other statistical methods like the correlation ratio, which measures the fraction of total information that is linked to the second image, have been demonstrated to work for image registration as well (Roche 1998).

The goal of our project is to co-register different imaging modalities through supervised machine learning. This adds the ability to improve over time through more training data and can be quickly adaptive to solve registration problems between different sets of imaging modalities.
